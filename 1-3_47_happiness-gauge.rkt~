; 3.7 Virtual Pet Worlds
; ======================

; Exercise 47. Design a world program that maintains and displays
; a “happiness gauge.”
; The gauge display starts with the maximum score, and with each
; clock tick, happiness decreases by -0.1; it never falls below 0,
; the minimum happiness score. Every time the down arrow key is
; pressed, happiness increases by 1/5; every time the up arrow is
; pressed, happiness jumps by 1/3.
; To show the level of happiness, we use a scene with a solid,
; red rectangle with a black frame.
